# Kaggle Competition Presentations

**For Instructors**: Remember to choose a Kaggle competition to share with the class in advance of class 5. There are many to choose from and you may want to select something topical.

Don't feel compelled to choose an ongoing challenge, past challenges can still be great learning opportunities.

**For Students**: 

During this last class each student will be asked to give a short (5-8 minute) presentation regarding their work on a Kaggle competition selected by the instructor. Here are two things you must do:

* Explore the data: make a few charts that highlight anything interesting you discover.
* Build a model: use `sklearn` to make at least one machine learning model and evaluate your results.
* Present your results to the class.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* **Most challenges prohibit sharing code and data unless you do so publicly. In the spirit of goodwill and in accordance with Kaggle rules, please share your code on the Kaggle forums if you're going to share it with the class. Sharing is caring, plus you might even get some helpful feedback!**
* You can present slides, code, a Jupyter notebook or a combination of all three.
* You may use any algorithms you like (though we suggest sticking with the ones provided by `sklearn`)
    * You may wish to try and compare several algorithms!
* Focus on learning more than getting a top-tier result.
    * Share your challenges, not just your successes.
    * Don't worry if you never get a great result, that's normal.
    * Do explore why your results aren't as good as you'd like and share a hypothesis for **why** you're getting this result and **how** you might improve it!
* You don't have to actually submit your model to Kaggle, but you do have to present your findings to the class!

This project is intentionally open-ended, challenge yourself by going above and beyond what we learned in class. Learn a new ML algorithm. Preprocess the data and attempt some "feature engineering." Create a really satisfying chart. 

Good luck!

## Three Good Options:

*Two of these competitions have ended, but accept 'late submissions' that allow you to have your model evaluated*  

* Classification: 
  * [The Classic Titanic Survival Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/)
  * [Forest Cover Type](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction)
* Regression: 
  * [Predict Bike Share Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/)
