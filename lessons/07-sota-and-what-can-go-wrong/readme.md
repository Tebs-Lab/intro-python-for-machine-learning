# Back To The Big Picture: Further Study and What Can Go Wrong

Machine learning is powerful, the state of the art in ML is pushing boundaries in everything from language translation to facial recognition. In this final class we'll name some of the big topics we didn't have time to cover in class, discuss the current state of the art, 
and provide some sign-posts for your continuing journey in machine learning.

Machine learning is also dangerous. Many uses of machine learning tactics have been found to perpetuate and even exacerbate societal bias. As we discuss some of the most advanced ML tactics, we'll also discuss some cautionary tales about ML gone awry and advice for avoiding these pitfalls.
