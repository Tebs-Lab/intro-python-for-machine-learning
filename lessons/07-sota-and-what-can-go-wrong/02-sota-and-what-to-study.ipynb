    "# Further Study and the State of The Art\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of a class like this one, you've just scratched the surface of what AI and ML. Even the handful of algorithms we presented here are quite flexible and can be applied to a number of different problems. But, every domain requires some specific practices/tatics. Plus, as new ML models continue to emerge the \"best practices\" are changing all the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the class is  meant to foster a discussion about the current state of the art and provide some potential topics and advice for further study based on your individual interests. \n",

    "## Classroom Exericise â€” Research Blitz\n",
    "\n",
    "In small teams (3-4) you will select a topic within the domain of AI and ML and perform a research blitz to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the current state of the art in this domain?\n",
    "    * How successful are the most successful models?\n",
    "    * How far along the road to commodification is this technology?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What kinds of models are popular in this domain?\n",
    "    * How is data prepared for consumption by these models?\n",
    "    * What is the output of these models?\n",
    "    * How is that output used / interpreted?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "    * How are the models deployed?\n",
    "    * Where are they used, and to what ends?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What is the benefit to using AI/ML rather than something else?\n",
    "    * Why automate this task?\n",
    "    * Why is a computer preferable to a human?\n",
    "    * Or, how does the computer complement the human aspects of the solution?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What are the risks?\n",
    "    * What are the potential sources of bias?\n",
    "    * Are there any well-documented failures to learn from?\n",
