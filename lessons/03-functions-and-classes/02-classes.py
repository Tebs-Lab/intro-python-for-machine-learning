# Classes are a form of complex data that combines data and functions.
# ML Libraries frequently provide classes as one of the main features, 
# where each model is a class that has an internal state as well as some
# useful functions for fitting/training the model and using it to make
# predictions.


# Classes are used throughout the programming industry, not just by ML
# folks.

class SimpleLinearRegression:
    """
    This simplistic implementation of linear regression assumes data is provided
    in a two dimensional space and creates a line of best fit using squared error.

    The resulting line is in the form y=mX+b where m is the slope of the regression
    line and b is the y-intercept of that line. We're using a classical formula for
    computing this line using covariance, but not explaining these concepts. For
    a more complete treatment of least squares regression see:

    NOTE: This code is meant as a tool to teach the conept of classes NOT as a tool for
    performing statistical analysis. Use Numpy, SciKit-Learn, or some other well
    tested library for your analytical needs.
