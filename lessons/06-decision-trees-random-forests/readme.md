# Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Hyper-Parameter Search

In this class we'll introduce two more models, the Decision Tree and the Random Forest. We'll also introduce the concept of "hyper-parameter search" â€” a widely used tactic to decide which hyper-parameters are most effective for a given dataset.

## Class Topics

* The Decision Tree algorithm
* Ensemble models
* Bagging
* Random Forests
* Hyper-parameter search
* Exercise:
    * Apply grid search with decision trees and random forests.
