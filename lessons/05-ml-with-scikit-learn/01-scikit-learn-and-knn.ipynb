This happens when a model more or less \"memorizes\" the training data, but performs poorly on data that is \"held out\" of the training process. A model that is \"overfit\" won't \"generalize\" to unseen data — making it useless in the real world!\n",

    "    * If we use the test data, and then change our model, the test data is no longer \"unbiased\" as we will have incorporated information from the test data (i.e. our models poor \"test performance\") into the next version of the model. In this case we have turned the test data into validation data, and we should get new test data.\n",

The training and test data will be saved separately, in their own folders or CSV files or labeled differently in the database/data warehouse software.\n",
