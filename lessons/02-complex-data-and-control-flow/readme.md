# Complex Data Types and Control Flow

Modern programs, especially machine learning programs, rely on large complex datasets. In this class we'll examine the two most foundational components of complex data: lists and dictionaries. Once we have seen these two collection types, we'll look at how to iteratively and selectively process individual items from the collections.

## Class Topics

* Lists and dictionaries
* Control Flow (if/elif/else)
* Looping
* Exercise: 
    * Create and modify lists and dictionaries
    * Search for items in a list
    * Create, modify, and select from nested lists and dictionaries
